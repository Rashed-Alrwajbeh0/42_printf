## Description

ft_printf function mimics the printf function.

The conversions that ft_printf uses:  

``%c`` prints a single character.

``%s`` prints a string.

``%d`` prints a decimal number.

``%i`` prints an integer in base 10.

``%u`` prints an unsigned decimal number.

``%x`` prints a number in hexadecimal in lowercase format.

``%X`` prints a number in hexadecimal in uppercase format.

``%%`` prints a percent sign.

```For unsupported conversion specifiers, the implementation prints the  %  character followed by the unknown specifier as literals.```

## Instructions

``make`` to compile  the functions related to ft_printf.

``make fclean`` to remove all the object files  related to ft_printf and ft_printf.a.

``make clean`` to remove all the object files related to ft_printf.

``make re`` to remove all object files that related to ft_printf and then make them again.

## Resources

I used some websites such as Google, Stack Overflow, and GeeksforGeeks.

I also used the manual pages and asked some friends.

## Algorithm

The `ft_printf` function processes the format string character by character.
When a regular character is found, it is written directly to the standard output.
When a percent sign (`%`) is encountered, the function checks the next character
to determine the conversion type.

According to the conversion specifier, `ft_printf` retrieves the corresponding
argument using `va_arg` and calls a dedicated helper function to print it.
Each helper function prints its value and returns the number of characters written.

The total number of printed characters is accumulated and returned at the end
of the function, matching the behavior of the standard `printf`.
